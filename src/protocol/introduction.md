# Introduction to Tongo

Tongo is a **confidential payment system** for ERC20 tokens on Starknet, providing privacy-preserving transactions while maintaining auditability and compliance features. Built on ElGamal encryption and zero-knowledge proofs, Tongo enables users to transact with hidden amounts while preserving the ability to verify transaction validity.

## What Makes Tongo Different

### No Trusted Setup

Unlike many ZK systems, Tongo requires **no trusted ceremony**. All cryptography is built on the discrete logarithm assumption over the Stark curve, with no hidden trapdoors or setup parameters.

### Native Starknet Integration

Tongo leverages Starknet's native elliptic curve operations, making verification extremely efficient (~120K Cairo steps per transfer) compared to other privacy solutions that require expensive proof verification.

### Flexible Compliance

The protocol supports multiple compliance models:

- **Global auditor**: All transactions encrypted for regulatory oversight
- **Selective disclosure**: Optional viewing keys per transaction
- **Ex-post proving**: Retroactive transaction disclosure without revealing keys

## How It Works

### 1. Key Generation

Each user generates a keypair \\((x, y = g^x)\\) where \\(g\\) is the Stark curve generator. The public key \\(y\\) serves as their account identifier.

### 2. Encrypted Balances

Balances are stored as ElGamal ciphertexts:

$$\text{Enc}[y](b, r) = (g^b y^r, g^r)$$

The encryption is **additively homomorphic**, allowing balance updates without decryption.

### 3. Zero-Knowledge Proofs

All operations require proofs built from three primitives:

- **POE (Proof of Exponent)**: Prove knowledge of discrete logs
- **PED (Pedersen)**: Prove commitment correctness
- **RAN (Range)**: Prove values are in valid ranges

### 4. Transaction Flow

**Fund** → **Transfer** → **Rollover** → **Withdraw**

1. **Fund**: Convert ERC20 to encrypted balance
2. **Transfer**: Send hidden amounts with ZK proofs
3. **Rollover**: Claim pending incoming transfers
4. **Withdraw**: Convert back to standard ERC20

## Core Operations

### Funding

Convert standard ERC20 tokens to encrypted balances:

```typescript
const fundOp = await account.fund({ amount: 1000n });
await signer.execute([fundOp.approve!, fundOp.toCalldata()]);
```

### Transfers

Send hidden amounts to other users:

```typescript
const transferOp = await account.transfer({
    to: recipientPubKey,
    amount: 100n,
});
await signer.execute([transferOp.toCalldata()]);
```

### Withdrawals

Convert back to standard ERC20 tokens:

```typescript
const withdrawOp = await account.withdraw({
    to: starknetAddress,
    amount: 50n
});
await signer.execute([withdrawOp.toCalldata()]);
```

## Security Model

### Privacy Guarantees

- **Balance confidentiality**: Only key holders (account owners and auditors) can decrypt balances
- **Transaction privacy**: Transfer amounts are hidden from public view

### Integrity Guarantees

- **No double spending**: Range proofs prevent negative balances
- **Conservation**: Total supply is preserved (no money creation)
- **Authenticity**: Only key owners can spend their balances

## Use Cases

### Individual Privacy

- **Personal transactions**: Hide transfer amounts from public view
- **Salary payments**: Confidential payroll systems

### Compliance

- **Optional Compliance for Institutions**: Deployer can chose weather to deploy with or without auditor keys
- **Treasury Management**: Confidential transfers with auditability for stakeholders

### Potential Integrations

- **Private AMM trading**: Hidden trade sizes
- **Neo-Bank Confidential Payments**: By design tongo can support payment procesors required speeds
- **DAO governance**: Confidential voting systems
