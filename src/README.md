# Tongo Documentation (Under Construction)

Welcome to the official Tongo documentation. Tongo is a confidential payment system for ERC20 tokens on Starknet, providing privacy-preserving transactions while maintaining auditability and compliance features. Tongo is heavily based on [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/191).

> **Waring** This documentation is under costruction. It is mostly done but we have to come back to round some rough edges. Use it wisely.
## What is Tongo?

Tongo wraps any ERC20 token with ElGamal encryption, enabling private transfers while maintaining full auditability. Built on zero-knowledge proofs and homomorphic encryption over the Stark curve, Tongo enables users to transact with hidden amounts while preserving the ability to verify transaction validity.

**Key Features:**
- **No Trusted Setup**: Built entirely on elliptic curve cryptography
- **Hidden Amounts**: All transfer amounts are encrypted
- **Flexible Compliance**: Global auditor support and selective disclosure
